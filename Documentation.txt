Leetcode_Testing:
An improved version of the Leetcode Reverse Integer Problem
Still based on a 32-bit integer for input, but can reverse any integer in that range.
It converts the input to a string and outputs the reversed integer, also as a string.
It loops through the code until the user input tells it to stop.
It also has an option to use the original Leetcode version of the solution.

P0824a:
A class project from Object Oriented Programming I.
It takes no input.
It outputs the results of the basic arithmetic functions in Java.
It displays results with positive and negative numbers

Lab1:
A lab project from Object Oriented Programming I.
The user inputs the number of cents they want to convert to dollars and coins.
It takes the input as an integer and divides the values of each coin (quarters, dimes, etc) into it.
After all values have been processed, it displays the minimum number of dollars and coins required to recreate the
value of the user's input.


Hw1:
A homework project from Object Oriented Programming I.
The user inputs test, homework, and lab scores into the program, as doubles.
It then processes and weighs each score into an average.
It then outputs the average for the scores.
The scores are weighted as follows:
midterm1: 10%
midterm2: 15%
final: 20%
quizzes: 15%
homework: 25%
lab assignments: 15%

The grades are input within ranges as follows:
midterm1: 0-80
midterm2: 0-100
final: 0-200
quizzes: 0-150
homework: 0-240
lab assignments: 0-300

The overall grade is output in the range 0-100
